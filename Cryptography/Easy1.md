Description:

The one time pad can be cryptographically secure, but not when you know the key.
Can you solve this? We've given you the encrypted flag, key, and a table to help UFJKXQZQUNB with the key of SOLVECRYPTO.
Can you use this table to solve it?.


values:
- UFJKXQZQUNB
- SOLVECRYPTO

To solve this, use same index of the values as pairs e.g. {S,U}, {O,F} and think what's in S to get U? it's C and so on...
